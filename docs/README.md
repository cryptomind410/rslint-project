# RSLint

RSLint is an extremely fast JavaScript linter written in Rust focusing on ease of use, customizability, and speed. RSLint
helps you find and fix error-prone productions in your code as well as enforce good practices.

## Docs

You can find user documentation for the linter [here](./user). You can also find documentation about individual rules [here](./rules). Finally,
there are dev docs [here](./dev) if you are interested in contributing to RSLint or knowing more about how it works.

## Note

⚠️ RSLint is still in early development, so expect bugs ⚠️
